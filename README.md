# MaaS_VC_Network_Model
This repository contains the source code for generating a time-dependent, multimodal and multi-attribute MaaS supernetwork model for a realistic prototypical city, i.e., a Virtual City. The network model is developed for MaaS trip planning applications and can be utilised for the evaluation of different shortest path algorithms. In this particular instance, the dynamic multicriteria shortest path algorithms proposed by Yfantis et al., 2021: "Optimal Multimodal and Multicriteria Path Set Computation for Dynamic Trip Planning in Mobility as a Service Systems" are tested and evaluated.

The source code for the dynamic multi-criteria path set generation algorithms can be found in https://github.com/LamprosYfantis/networkx/blob/placeholder/networkx/algorithms/simple_paths.py. The description of the Virtual City, along with the data for it can be found in https://github.com/smart-fm/simmobility-prod/wiki/Demo-Data and https://drive.google.com/file/d/10oC8u8HMtfeJCn-dWs2H7ESxItySFbC_/view?usp=sharing.
