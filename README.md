# MaaS_VC_Network_Model
This repository contains the source code for generating a dynamic, multimodal and multi-attribute MaaS Network model for a realistic prototypical multimodal network, i.e., a Virtual City.

The network model is developed for MaaS Trip planning applications and it has been utilised for the evaluation of dynamic and multicriteria shortest path set generation algorithms - Yfantis et al., 2021: "Optimal Multimodal and Multicriteria Path Set Computation for Dynamic Trip Planning in Mobility as a Service Systems".

The source code for the path set generation algorithms can be found in https://github.com/LamprosYfantis/networkx/blob/MaaS_Path_Set_Generation_Algorithms/networkx/algorithms/simple_paths.py

The description of the Virtual City, along with the data for it can be found in https://github.com/smart-fm/simmobility-prod/wiki/Demo-Data and https://drive.google.com/file/d/10oC8u8HMtfeJCn-dWs2H7ESxItySFbC_/view?usp=sharing.
