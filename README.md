# MaaS_VC_Network_Model
This repository contains the source code for generating a time-dependent, multimodal and multi-attribute MaaS supernetwork model for a realistic prototypical city, i.e., a Virtual City. The network model is developed for MaaS trip planning applications and can be utilised for the evaluation of different shortest path algorithms, as in Yfantis et al., 2021: "Optimal Multimodal and Multicriteria Path Set Computation for Dynamic Trip Planning in Mobility as a Service Systems".

The source code for the path set generation algorithms can be found in https://github.com/LamprosYfantis/networkx/blob/placeholder/networkx/algorithms/simple_paths.py. The description of the Virtual City, along with the data for it can be found in https://github.com/smart-fm/simmobility-prod/wiki/Demo-Data and https://drive.google.com/file/d/10oC8u8HMtfeJCn-dWs2H7ESxItySFbC_/view?usp=sharing.

The python file that contains the code for generating the MaaS supernetwrok model is in
